 Quick, Time This
==================
Time C stuff, really accurately, really easily.


Example Usage
-------------
./qtt.py -c atof "double (char*)" '("1"),("100000000.23242")'


What?
======
Time your C functions!

This is terrible!
-----------------
Duh. its python code that generates C code and shoves it into gcc, what did you expect?

How do I use it?
----------------
It doesn't have install yet, run it from the checkout directory.

It should work on all x86-64 systems.

./qtt.py --help does a thing
